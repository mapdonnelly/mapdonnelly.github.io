I am passionate about disease ecology and One Health approaches in public health. I believe that the key to improving global health is to use ecological and systemic approaches to understand how changing environments, the movement of invasive species, and globalization result in increases in new and emerging diseases. I am specifically interested in developing GIS and biological models to estimate spatial and temporal dynamics of vector-borne diseases, including dengue and Zika. Additionally, I am interested in investigating the human-mosquito ecological dynamics that propagate transmission, and the vector-control methods that most effectively reduce transmission.
